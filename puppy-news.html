                    <p class="unicorn-para">The unicorn puppy, affectionately called Narwhal, was found abandoned with a secondary tail on his head. 
                        The extra tail is said to cause no pain for the puppy but is a very cute addition to an already adorable face.
                        The tail is about a third of the size of his actual tail and does not stop him from running around and playing for hours.
